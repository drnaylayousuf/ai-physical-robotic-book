  "description": "In ROS 2, a node is an executable that performs a specific task. Think of nodes as modular, independent programs that communicate with each other to achieve a larger robotic goal. For example, one node might be responsible for reading data from a LiDAR sensor, another for calculating the robot's position, and yet another for sending commands to motors.",
