  "description": "While Gazebo excels as a physics-accurate simulator for ROS 2, Unity, a powerful real-time 3D development platform, offers unparalleled capabilities for high-fidelity visualization, complex environmental rendering, and rich human-robot interaction (HRI) experiences. This makes Unity an excellent complementary tool for physical AI and humanoid robotics, especially when the visual fidelity and intuitive interaction are paramount.",
