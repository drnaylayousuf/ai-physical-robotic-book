  "description": "Topics are the most common way for nodes to exchange data in ROS 2. They implement a publish/subscribe communication model, enabling asynchronous, one-to-many data streaming. A node publishes messages to a named topic, and any other node interested in that data can subscribe to the same topic to receive those messages.",
