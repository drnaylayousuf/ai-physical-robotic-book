  "description": "Actions in ROS 2 are designed for long-running, goal-oriented tasks that may require periodic feedback and the ability to be preempted (cancelled). They build upon the concepts of topics and services, providing a more robust communication pattern for complex operations like moving a robot to a target pose, grasping an object, or performing a lengthy computation.",
