  "description": "Multimodal interaction represents the next frontier in conversational robotics, moving beyond speech-only interfaces to incorporate multiple channels of communication including vision, gesture, touch, and context. By integrating information from various sensory modalities, robots can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of human intentions, provide richer feedback, and engage in more natural, intuitive interactions that mirror human communication patterns.",
