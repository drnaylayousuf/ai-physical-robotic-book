  "title": "Gazebo and Physics Simulation: Bringing Robots to Life Virtually",
  "description": "Gazebo is a powerful open-source 3D robotics simulator that allows you to accurately test your robot designs and algorithms in a virtual environment. It's an essential tool for physical AI development, providing realistic physics simulation, high-quality rendering, and a robust interface for sensors and actuators. For humanoid robots, which involve complex dynamics and balance, Gazebo's accurate physics engine is indispensable.",
