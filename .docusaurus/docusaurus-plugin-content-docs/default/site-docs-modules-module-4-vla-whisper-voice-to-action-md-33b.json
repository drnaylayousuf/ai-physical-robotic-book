  "description": "In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) robotics, the ability for a robot to understand spoken human commands is a crucial interface. This is where advanced Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models like OpenAI's Whisper play a pivotal role. Whisper, trained on a massive dataset of diverse audio, can accurately transcribe human speech into text, which can then be processed by Large Language Models (LLMs) for task planning and execution in robots.",
