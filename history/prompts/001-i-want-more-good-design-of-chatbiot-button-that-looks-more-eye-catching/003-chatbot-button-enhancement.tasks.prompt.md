# Prompt

$ARGUMENTS
```

# Response

```
I've generated a comprehensive task list for implementing the chatbot button enhancement. The tasks.md file includes:

1. **Phase 1: Setup** - Backup and preparation tasks (3 tasks)
2. **Phase 2: Foundational Styling** - CSS variables and basic styling updates (7 tasks)
3. **Phase 3: User Story 1** - Enhanced Visual Design (P1 priority, 8 tasks)
4. **Phase 4: User Story 2** - Improved Interactive Feedback (P2 priority, 8 tasks)
5. **Phase 5: User Story 3** - Modern Animation Effects (P3 priority, 9 tasks)
6. **Phase 6: Polish** - Cross-cutting concerns and quality assurance (9 tasks)

The task list contains 44 specific, actionable tasks with proper formatting including:
- Sequential task IDs (T001-T044)
- Parallel execution markers [P] where appropriate
- User story labels [US1], [US2], [US3] mapping to priorities
- Specific file paths for each task
- Clear implementation steps following the design plan

Key features of the task implementation:
- Preserves all existing functionality while enhancing visual design
- Implements CSS custom properties for consistent theming
- Follows modern design principles for improved user experience
- Maintains responsive design and accessibility standards
- Organized in priority order with MVP scope (User Story 1) as foundation
- Addresses both the button enhancement and "chatbot box icon" improvement
```
