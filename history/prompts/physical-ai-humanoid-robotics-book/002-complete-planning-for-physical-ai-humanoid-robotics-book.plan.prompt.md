<command-name>/sp.plan</command-name>
<command-args>Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Building Embodied Intelligent Systems

INSTRUCTION TO AI:
You are an expert technical writer, curriculum designer, and robotics engineer. Your task is to generate a complete book using Docusaurus structure and the Spec-Kit Plus methodology. I will manually set up the Docusaurus environment; your job is to produce all book content, structure, chapters, sidebars, API references, diagrams, code blocks, and assets in Markdown.

Follow this specification exactly.

📘 BOOK WRITING SPECIFICATION
1. BOOK GOAL & SCOPE

Produce a full textbook that teaches Physical AI—AI systems that interact with the physical world—centered around Humanoid Robotics, ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, and Vision-Language-Action systems.

The book must cover:

Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence

ROS 2 Fundamentals

Gazebo & Unity Simulation

NVIDIA Isaac Platform

Bipedal Control & Humanoid Mechanics

Vision-Language-Action Robotics (LLM-Driven Robots)

Conversational Robotics (Speech → Action)

Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid Project

Lab Setup, Hardware Requirements, and Cloud Architecture

2. STRUCTURE THE BOOK USING DOCUSAURUS FORMAT

Produce content in this folder structure:

/docs
    /intro
        overview.md
        why-physical-ai-matters.md
        learning-outcomes.md

    /modules
        /module1-ros2
            intro.md
            ros2-architecture.md

/sidebar.js  (auto-generated by AI)


Each file must contain:

Clear headings

Diagrams (ASCII or Mermaid syntax)

Code examples (Python, ROS 2 rclpy, URDF, etc.)

System architectures

Tables

Step-by-step instructions

Project snippets

3. WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES

Write like a robotics textbook used at a university.

Tone: clear, authoritative, practical, not overly academic.

Include diagrams (Mermaid) and robot architecture charts.

Provide real code that can run.

Include examples of ROS 2 rclpy nodes, URDF files, Nav2 configs, and Isaac Sim scripts.

Include exercises and checkpoints per chapter.

Ensure hardware sections are actionable and realistic.

Cross-link chapters using Docusaurus Markdown conventions.

Create a glossary, index, and recommended resources page.

4. SPECIAL REQUIREMENT: INTEGRATE THE PROVIDED COURSE MATERIAL

All content from the source text I provided must be incorporated, expanded, structured, and explained in textbook-quality depth.
You must transform the raw course description into a polished, complete book.

Do not copy word-for-word—rewrite into refined, coherent textbook prose.

5. SPEC-KIT PLUS REQUIREMENTS

Generate:

book.yaml (Spec-Kit Plus config)

Each Markdown chapter

Table of contents

Sidebar definitions

Assets folder structure

API reference stubs

You may generate long outputs—this is expected.

6. AI TOOLS ASSUMED AVAILABLE TO YOU

You may use:

Claude Code (supports multi-file generation)

Spec-Kit Plus (for spec-driven documentation generation)

Docusaurus Markdown syntax

Mermaid diagrams

Code fences for syntax highlighting

7. FINAL INSTRUCTION

Once you begin, generate the entire book content file by file, starting by producing:

book.yaml

Docusaurus sidebar structure

Chapter files

Images/diagrams (in Markdown/ASCII/Mermaid)

Appendices, Glossary, Resources
update and upgrade means upgrade the previous plan by this one

## Response snapshot

I have completed the plan and updated the plan file as requested.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Planning for book generation completed.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests run during planning.
- 📁 Files: Created/updated C:\Users\nayla\.claude\plans\jazzy-snacking-falcon.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with implementation based on the plan.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully upgraded the plan with the new specification.
- 📝 Summary: This PHR records the completion of the planning phase for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book. The plan has been updated to reflect the detailed specifications provided by the user, covering content, structure, style, and integration requirements. The next step is to proceed with the implementation, generating the book content file by file.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Initial attempt to create PHR via Bash script failed due to environment execution issues (PowerShell within Bash on Windows).
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Investigate robust cross-platform execution of PHR creation script, or formalize agent-native PHR creation as primary method.
