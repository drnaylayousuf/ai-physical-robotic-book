# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course! This book is designed to guide you through the exciting world of embodied intelligence, where AI systems interact with the physical world through robotic bodies. Over the next 13 weeks, you will learn to build, simulate, and control autonomous humanoids that respond to voice commands, using cutting-edge technologies like ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac Sim.

## Course Goal

Our primary objective is to equip you with the knowledge and practical skills to **build a simulated autonomous humanoid that follows voice commands**. This involves a comprehensive exploration of:

*   **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**: The backbone for robotic software development.
*   **Gazebo & Unity**: Platforms for creating realistic digital twins and simulations.
*   **NVIDIA Isaac Sim & Isaac ROS**: Advanced tools for robotics simulation, synthetic data generation, and AI-powered perception.
*   **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Integrating natural language understanding, visual perception, and robotic action.
*   **Whisper + LLM Planning**: Using OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text and Large Language Models for high-level task planning.
*   **Digital Twins + Bipedal Locomotion**: Developing virtual replicas of robots and mastering the complexities of two-legged movement.

## Why Physical AI?

The field of Physical AI is at the forefront of technological innovation. It's about creating intelligent agents that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world. From manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and exploration, humanoid robots powered by advanced AI are poised to revolutionize numerous industries. This course provides a unique opportunity to contribute to this transformative field.
